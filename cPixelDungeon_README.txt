cPixelDungeon- New version (1.7.1c.51sco)

I have created a mod (cPixelDungeon) which makes PixelDungeon a bit more fun for me. Mostly, I have taken a lot of unknowns out, as well as increasing the hero's Hit Points and Strength at the beginning. I thought I would share.

FEATURES:
Able to install without uninstalling PixelDungeon
Scroll Of Identity is no longer present as a random scroll
Scrolls Magic Mapping, Remove Curse and Psionic Blast are now more common
Ring Of Detection (no use when cheats are on) instead gives 100 turns of Mind Vision
Toggle cheats on or off in settings menu
HP starts with an extra 10 points
Strength starts with an extra 10 points
All items are immediately known WHEN PICKED UP (Note that this means if you don't know an item, it won't be known in the stores)
All secret doors are visible
All traps are visible
Huntress always available
Scroll of Upgrade on every level
Added "c" to clock in bottom left corner (no more pretending you beat the original :-) )

INSTALLATION:
Since this is not in the appstore, you need to Download the linked apk file below. Somehow get it to your phone (email, SD Card). Then, you need to turn on "Unknown Sources" in your phone's security settings. Then open the apk file. It will install it.


USE:
Open the game, go into settings and check the "Use Cheats" checkbox for cheats to work.

POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES:
